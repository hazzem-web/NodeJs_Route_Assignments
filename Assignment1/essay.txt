type conversion : is the way to convert any type of data to another type like i want a number of string "123" 
let x = "123" 
console.log (typeof Number(x) ) 


type corecion : 1- if you make concatination between string and number the output type is string 
                2- if you but a minus between number and str the output type is number 

x = 8;
x+= "2";
console.log(x);
console.log(typeof x);

z = "8"
z-= 2
console.log(z);
console.log(typeof z)
