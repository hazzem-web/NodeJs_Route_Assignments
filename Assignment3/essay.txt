1 - Event Loop :     takes your code and cetgorize it to 3 main catgories by this order
                     1- timersOperartion (setTimeout , setInterval , setImmediate)
                     2- longRunningOperation (fileSystem , crypto)
                     3- osOperation (HTTP Server)
                     implement this code by this priority (Non_Blocking)


2 - Llibuv : is a pure(100%) c++ library that handle complex operations in NodeJs that Js can't handle 
             resopnsible for async i/o , fileSystem in your code 



3 - NodeJs handle async operations with libuv , v8 as v8 takes your written code and convert it to c++ and send it to libuv
    libuv can handle async functions by c++ as it's low-level language and can can access your memory and i/o
   


4 - call satck  : is the order of operations last in first out (LIFO)
    Event Queue : is the order or priority of operations in your code ( who is first ) first in fisrt out (FIFO)
    Event Loop  : handling the sync , async operations in your code when you run the project (with libuv , v8)  

5 - ThreadPool is a simulation of parallel programming using javaScript that's allow to run 4 threads in one process by default
    you can custmize the number of threads by chanaging the variable UV_ThreadPool 



6 - Blocking     : js wait untill the blocking code execution synchronuns operation , line by line and wait this blocking code 

    Non-Blocking : asynchronuns code , js implement the other functions in the code untill the Non_Blocking code implement thier opeartions
                   not affect the other parts of code this is by event loop structure
